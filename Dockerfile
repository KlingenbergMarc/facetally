# OPTIMIZED SOLUTION

# tensorflow base-images are optimized: lighter than python-buster + pip install tensorflow

FROM python:3.10-buster

# This line sets the working directory within the container to /prod.
# This directory will be used as the default location for subsequent commands.f

# libraries required by OpenCV
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install \

# We strip the requirements from useless packages for user
# This line copies the contents of the requirements_prod.txt file from the host machine
# to the /prod directory in the container  and renames it to requirements.txt.
COPY requirementsAPI.txt requirements.txt

# Update pip
RUN pip install --upgrade pip

# This line installs the Python dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using the pip package manager.
# It will run the file which was originally requirementsAPI.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# These lines copy the directory, setup.py file, and any associated content from the host machine
# to the /prod directory in the container.
COPY face_tally face_tally
COPY setup.py setup.py

# This line installs the Python package located in the current directory (.),
# which includes the contents of the face_tally directory and is specified by the setup.py file.
RUN pip install .

# This line copies the Makefile from the host machine to the /prod directory in the container.
COPY Makefile Makefile

# This line runs the make reset_local_files command inside the container.
# It likely executes some tasks defined in the Makefile.
# (LINE COMMENTED UNTIL USEFULL MAKE COMMAND TO RUN)
# RUN make reset_local_files




# This line specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
# It uses uvicorn to run the FastAPI application (taxifare.api.fast:app) with specific host and port settings.
# The $PORT environment variable is expected to be provided at runtime.
CMD uvicorn face_tally.API.fast:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT


# IMPORTANT!! Try before if it works of the console with this line:
# uvicorn face_tally.API.fast:app --reload --port 8000

# SINTAX OF COPY:

# COPY <src> <dest>
# <src> represents the source path on the host machine (the machine where you're building the Docker image).
# <dest> represents the destination path inside the container.

# <src> is requirementsAPI.txt on the host machine.
# <dest> is requirements.txt inside the container.




# RUN vs CMD:

# The RUN instruction is used to execute commands during the build process of the Docker image.
# The CMD instruction is used to provide default command(s) that will be executed when a container is run from the built image.
